# Pose_Estimation

## Pose estimation applied to physical therapy project.

Physiotherapy and rehabilitation clinics have difficulties related to cost and practicality in continuous follow-up and tend to extend out-of-office treatment. Performing exercises at home limits the supervision and correction of the exercises, impairing the recovery of the patient. This work deals with the proposal of an assistive device in physiotherapy exercises, by means of a pose estimation algorithm embedded in a system on chip (SoC). The algorithm, based on convolutional neural networks, uses a reference video to give visual feedback in real time to the user. Thus, allowing the execution of an exercise closer to the proposed, in addition to provide data for a remote monitoring by the physiotherapist.

This is being done as a class project at UnB, with potential of becoming a real product.
